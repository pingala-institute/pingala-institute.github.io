# Research

The Pingla Institute is an independent non-profit research institute devoted to multidisciplinary research. Our current focus is research in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Hindu Studies, and Comparative Religion.

Our overarching goal is to develop and promote a research program that spans data science, philosophy and religious studies. We are a diverse group of independent academics with strong multi-disciplinary experience and international collaborators across many fields.
