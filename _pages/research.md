### Machine Learning and data science 

We are interested in developing the next generation of machine learning models that address the grand challenges in artificial intelligence, including the development of models for sparse and missing data, uncertainty quantification in predictions, class imbalance and extreme value forecasting. We are currently extending extreme-value forecasting deep learning model with Bayesian inference for enabling uncertainty quantification in predictions. Furthermore, we are developing compact Bayesian neural networks through post-pruning via a Monte Carlo approach. Particularly, we are keen in data imputation, particularly uncertainty quantification in imputation models and also extension of such models in spatiotemporal data imputation.   We plan to enhance the Bayesian deep learning models with data augmentation methods for multi-modal data fusion utilising a wide range of data streams. Furthermore, we plan to use a combination of variational inference and Monte Carlo sampling methods to provide uncertainty quantification in the data and the model space. We also envision incorporating explainable artificial intelligence and knowledge distillation techniques in our models.

### Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models 

Modern natural language processing deep learning models have accelerated research into the major  fields of computational linguistics. The Transformer deep learning architecture has improved performance for tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification and named entity recognition. In addition, its generative abilities have improved translation and summarizations performance in a range of domains. Nevertheless, the improvements are not uniformly distributed across all languages and domains. In this research stream, we develop  machine learning models  for specific language applications and evaluate the performance of large language models for machine translation using sentiment and semantic analysis. We provide longitudinal study of social media and news media when it comes to political issues such as Sinophobia, Hinduphobia, Antisemitism, and anti-vaccination trends. Furthermore, we review political speeches in the United States Presidential elections in terms of sentiments, abusive language and personal attacks. We are keen in using large language models at specialised domains such as low-resource languages and area of humanities and social science that struggle with research funding. In addition, we explore the newer emergent themes in natural language processing, such as reasoning, deception, and world models implicit in text generation.

### Earth Science

We promote sustainable exploration practices, improving our understanding of Earthâ€™s resources, and assessing the impacts of human activities on natural landscapes. We aspire to contribute significantly to responsible resource management and environmental stewardship through the integration of artificial intelligence and geosciences. Under this theme, we aim to harness advanced machine learning and deep learning models, to transform mineral exploration and environmental monitoring. We plan to develop innovative data driven methods that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of mineral discovery. We build on our previous expertise (data and models) in creating reliable multidimensional prospective models.  Furthermore, we develop novel methodologies to innovate the processing of remote sensing data through machine learning and uncover deeper insights into geological formations and environmental change. We are keen to develop novel remote sensing tools driven by machine learning and deep learning methods that are not only limited to our planet, but also applicable to study remote sensing data for Mars and the moon.   We are also interested in using machine learning and Bayesian inference methods for the application of landscape evolution models in studying the paleoclimate and geological history of the planet. Finally, we envision the usage of plate tectonic models such as GPlates for the acquisition of data for region-specific mineral productivity mapping.

### Environmental Modelling and Climate Extremes



The drastic effect of climate change is visible given extreme weather conditions such as tropical storms and cyclones.  Currently, we are using deep learning for forecasting cyclone genesis in the coming decades given drastic changes in the climate via sea surface temperature data from the general circulation model (GCM). Furthermore, we  developed novel conditional ensemble learning framework for modelling streamflow and flood prediction in selected Australian catchments using precipitation and environmental data.   We are interested in using machine learning and Bayesian inference methods to integrate landscape evolution models with reef evolution models to have a better understanding of the development of the Great Barrier Reef and other reef systems around the planet. Finally, we envision robust remote sensing and machine learning models for environmental management and post-disaster management including landslides, cyclones, and floods.

### Bioinformatics and Medicine  

We are interested in various biomedical data problems that can be solved using machine learning models. These problems range from pure molecular biology problems where we process data about specific biological molecules to predict properties such as function, movement, structure or interactions with other molecules. These problems contribute to fundamental research into drug discovery and the causal processes involved in diseases. At the other end of the spectrum, we look at biomedical data science problems that involve improving the processes by which human beings receive treatment. We are keen in building machine learning models that determine whether people are susceptible to complications during surgery, or short-term readmission following discharge from the hospital. These models help improve the efficiency of medical care and thereby help lift the quality of care. We envision the development of novel deep learning models that can incorporate uncertainty projections in predictions for medical data imputation and clinical decision making process. Furthermore, our focus is in the development of novel deep learning models with uncertainty   projection in guiding medical practitioners with digital twin models.

### Finance and Economics  

The challenges in economics  intersect with machine learning in areas including forecasting, causal inference, and social choice theory with ensemble learning methods such as bagging. This also includes model learning paradigms in general, e.g. reinforcement learning, submodular function learning, and preference learning. Our multidisciplinary focus has led to a project that used recurrent neural networks for decadal economic forecasting, focusing on  country-wise GDP growth. Currently, we are developing an ease of living index using data imputation and dimensionality reduction methods which will be later used for developing novel deep learning models for the decadal cost of living outlook. We are also developing a variational deep learning model for uncertainty quantification in stock price forecasting and multimodal deep learning that incorporates text and numeral data streams with large language models for credit rating forecasting. In future, there is scope for multimodal data fusion for forecasting decadal economic trends taking into account, energy utilisation, climate change, migration and estimates of poverty elimination. Applications include environmental and resource economics, climate change, distributive justice, and fair allocation.

### Cinema and Social Dynamics


The  cinema and music industry has been used as an instrument to promote social change which has also been widely abused. Therefore, longitudinal study of the impact of cinema and music on society can be helpful in reforms and education policies. This is also a concern as social media and news media have been mediums influencing and disseminating information that had an impact on culture, social dynamics and politics.  One of our projects focuses on evaluating the right and left-wing biases of developed and emerging economies and studying how they impact political and economic development. We envision the use of large language models and computer vision methods for the analysis of movies, scripts, and songs from the viewpoint of social sciences, economics and psychology. The focus is not just Hollywood, but world cinema, including the evolution of Indian cinema.

### Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is a field that forms one of the core spokes of cognitive science. It asks us to try and understand the mind by replicating some of its behaviour. As it progresses these questions encroach on the world of pure philosophy which has always engaged humanity in the question of understanding the nature of knowledge, experience, rationality and sentience. We explore the questions that are emerging from cutting-edge research, as well as the cross-cultural consideration of these technologies and their impact on society. Furthermore, we envision a multidisciplinary approach that looks into philosophical aspects of artificial intelligence from the viewpoint of machine consciousness, psychology,  philosophy of mind, and comparative religion.

## Centre for Hindu Studies 

Research Directors: Sushrut Badhe and Dr Rohitash Chandra

### Hindu Philosophy and Modern Science 

Hinduism is one of the world's oldest living religions, encompassing nine major philosophical schools that include three non-theist schools known as Jainism, Buddhism and Carvaka.
The school of Vedanta has gained a major following in the west with the rise of a non-dualist school of thought known as Advaita-Vedanta which proponents such as Radhakrishnan, Mahatama Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda. The foundations of the development of major Hindu schools include Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Vedas, and Upanishads that have insights on human psychology, emotional resilience, leadership, management, and spiritual well-being. We aim to integrate these principles with modern psychological frameworks and promote harmonious and sustainable living environment.  Our focus is on reviewing ancient Indian philosophical  traditions and their relevance in contemporary life and outline the key contributions of Hindu philosophy in history that has paved the way of modern science and humanities.

### Ayurveda and Wellness 

The centre emphasises the exploration of Ayurvedic practices, Vedic therapeutics, and their role in enhancing physical and mental health. Research will focus on integrating these traditional approaches with contemporary medical science, offering innovative practices for improved health and balanced living.   


Theme Leaders: Sushrut Badhe and Dr Avinash Karpe

### Artificial Intelligence for Hinduism and Comparative Religion
Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, the centre explores the decoding, comparison, and analysis of Sanskrit texts, including the Vedas, Upanishads, and other Hindu scriptures. This research involves developing advanced tools for linguistic analysis and contextual translations, making Hindu philosophy  accessible to the modern world. We envision the usage of large language models to draw connections between major philosophical schools of Hinduism and Buddhism. Our current focus is on large language models for developing Vedanta-GPT based on the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads and the analysis of translations by large language models (eg. Gemini and GPT) of Indian languages and Hindu texts using semantic and sentiment analysis.
