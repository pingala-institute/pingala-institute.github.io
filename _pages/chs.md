## Centre for Hindu Studies 

Research Directors: Sushrut Badhe and Dr Rohitash Chandra

### Hindu Philosophy and Modern Science 

Hinduism is one of the world's oldest living religions, encompassing nine major philosophical schools that include three non-theist schools known as Jainism, Buddhism and Carvaka.
The school of Vedanta has gained a major following in the west with the rise of a non-dualist school of thought known as Advaita-Vedanta which proponents such as Radhakrishnan, Mahatama Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda. The foundations of the development of major Hindu schools include Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Vedas, and Upanishads that have insights on human psychology, emotional resilience, leadership, management, and spiritual well-being. We aim to integrate these principles with modern psychological frameworks and promote harmonious and sustainable living environment.  Our focus is on reviewing ancient Indian philosophical  traditions and their relevance in contemporary life and outline the key contributions of Hindu philosophy in history that has paved the way of modern science and humanities.

### Ayurveda and Wellness 

The centre emphasises the exploration of Ayurvedic practices, Vedic therapeutics, and their role in enhancing physical and mental health. Research will focus on integrating these traditional approaches with contemporary medical science, offering innovative practices for improved health and balanced living.

### Artificial Intelligence for Hinduism and Comparative Religion
Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, the centre explores the decoding, comparison, and analysis of Sanskrit texts, including the Vedas, Upanishads, and other Hindu scriptures. This research involves developing advanced tools for linguistic analysis and contextual translations, making Hindu philosophy  accessible to the modern world. We envision the usage of large language models to draw connections between major philosophical schools of Hinduism and Buddhism. Our current focus is on large language models for developing Vedanta-GPT based on the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads and the analysis of translations by large language models (eg. Gemini and GPT) of Indian languages and Hindu texts using semantic and sentiment analysis.
