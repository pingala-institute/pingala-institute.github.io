#### Vision and Significance
<p>
We named our research institute to pay tribute to the contributions of many ancient and modern scientists and philosophers. The Pingla Institute is named after ancient Indian philosopher, poet and mathematician [Archarya Pingla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala) (3rd Century BCE) who laid the foundations of the [binary number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)  that serves as the backbone of modern computing and artificial intelligence. Archarya Pingla also contributed to Sanskrit prosody ([Vedanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanga)), also known as the limbs of the  [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas). The Vedas are sacred and the oldest set of Hindu texts.  Archarya Pingla as a polymath well represents Pingla Institue's core multidisciplinary research vision enabling the convergence of science, philosophy and spirituality.
